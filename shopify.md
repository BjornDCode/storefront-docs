## Shopify
Storefront uses [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) as a backend. It's a great tool to run and manage your webshop. It's not absolutely required that you know a lot about Shopify in order to start building a Storefront project. But there a few basics that you should be aware of. 

If you are new to Shopify I recommend taking a look at the [terminology](/docs/{{version}}/terminology) page to learn the basics of Shopify.

### Plans
There are 5 different Shopify plans. If you go to the [pricing](https://www.shopify.com/pricing) page, you can see 3 main ones. They are Basic Shopify, Shopify and Advanced Shopify. The price range in these plans run from 29$ to 299$ per month. 

There are however two other plans available as well. [Shopify Plus](https://www.shopify.com/plus) is an enterprice solution for large websites with specific needs for speed, stability and customization. The other is [Shopify Lite](https://www.shopify.com/lite) which is only 9$ per month. With Shopify Lite you don't have access to an online store hosted on Shopify's servers. But you still have API access, which means it can be used with Storefront.

All other plans work with Storefront as well.

### Developer Account
While Shopify offers a 14 day free trial, this is not always enough to finish a project. Instead you can create a [developer account](https://developers.shopify.com/). This allows you to create unlimited free test stores. You can even build a client project as a test store and then transfer it to a client when complete. It's free to sign up for an account.

## Storefront API
The [Storefront API](https://help.shopify.com/api/storefront-api) is a public API for your webshop. It's a GraphQL API which is why it's recommended to know the basics of GraphQL and Apollo when working with Storefront. It's a good idea to have a look through the api docs to see exactly what data can be queried.
